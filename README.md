## XAI_CODS
Camouflaged Object Detection and Segmentation (COD/S) with Explainable AI 

### Dataset: 
  COD10K-TR[^1] consisting of 6K images (3040 concealed objects & 2960 non-concealed objects).
  Images are divied into 6 categories (Aquatic, Atmobios, Terrestrial, Amphibian, Other, and Background) and 78 sub-classes.

### FACE-P1 High-Level Overview:
  Utilizing the SEDA[^2] architecture, Fing and Acquire Camouflage Explainability Phase 1 (FACE-P1) focuses on explaining the predictions of CODS.

The input image is of size CxHxW (Channel by Height by Width).

The Feature Extractor (ResNet50) is used to 

The Sequence Interpreter module outputs a COL map (localization map) for segmentation which is a matrix of size HxW with a numeric value of 0 or 1 assigned to each matrix cell (aka pixel).

COL Table:

The Attention module outputs a COR map (ranking map) which is a matrix of size HxW with a numeric value assigned to each matrix cell (aka pixel).

The Decision Generator module takes the COL and COR maps to create the final COD/S image segmentation output and creates some underlying reasoning behind the decision-making process.
